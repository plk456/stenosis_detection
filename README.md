## Project Title
AI-Based-Early-Disease-Detection-System

## Description
## HEART FAILURE PREDICTION
in this project you can predict the risk level and risk score of heart failure by entering the symptoms and your health checkup details.

## STENOSIS DETECTION:

Stenosis detection is primarily useful for cardiologists, radiologists, and other healthcare professionals involved in diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases. It helps in early identification of blockages in arteries, which can lead to conditions like heart attacks and strokes. Accurate and timely detection of stenosis is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment and potentially preventing serious complications.  

## MOUTH CANCER:
Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the mouth, including the lips, tongue, floor of the mouth, cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth. It can also affect the tonsils and salivary glands. This cancer arises when cells within these areas mutate and grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor. 

## Features
o	Stenosis-detection – Used Yolov11 model to detect the coronary artery stenosis.

o	Heart-Failure - In heart Failure you have to provide your symptoms and heart health checkup details.

o	Mouth-cancer-detection—Used Yolov11 model to detect the mouth cancer.

o	Good-UI – simple and anyone can easily enter the health report/health details.

## Technology Used

•	Backend: Python, Flask

•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

•	Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, YOLO ( you only look once)

## SUMMARY
In summary, CAD-coronary artery stenosis and the resulting CAD are major causes of death globally and in the United States and MOUTH_CANCER-Globally, there are approximately 177,757 deaths from oral cancer every year. This is a significant number, representing a 5-year mortality rate close to 50%. 
Early detection, prevention, and effective treatment are crucial for improving outcomes and reducing mortality from this condition.
